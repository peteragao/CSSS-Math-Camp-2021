## Welcome to Math Camp!

Historically, Math Camp has been a 5-day review course covering algebra, matrix algebra, calculus, and probability. This year, lectures will be uploaded before the week of Math Camp. Lectures are intended to be watched outside of synchronous class time. During our synchronous Zoom meetings, we will discuss topics from lectures, address questions, and work through examples together and in small groups. The programming language R will be introduced in synchronous afternoon labs, where we will work through examples together over Zoom (no preparation is necessary for lab). 

  **Instructor:** Peter Gao, Graduate Student, Dept. of Statistics  
  **TA:** Jessica Kunke, Graduate Student, Dept. of Statistics    

## Schedule

The daily schedule may vary as we adapt to an online version of Math Camp, but the tentative synchronous learning schedule is as follows:  

  **10:00am-10:45am**  Review lectures and practice problems (First day, introduction)  
  **10:45am-11:30am**  Breakout Rooms: Practice problems  
  **1:30pm-3:00pm**    R labs  
  **3:00pm-4:00pm**    Additional problem session/office hours (if needed)  

Slides and materials will be linked to in the schedule below as they are made available. The materials provided here have been largely created by previous CSSS Math Camp instructors, including [Jessica Godwin](https://jlgodwin.github.io/MathCamp).
